Multiplication matrices algorithm with using 2d grid plan:

1. Init 2 matrices as usual array.
2. Init matrix entity (i'm using Mpi_cart_create).
3. Split the matrix into processes row by row.
4. Split the matrix into processes column by column.
5. Scatter matrix to 0 index columns and row
6. Broadcast to other processes.
7. Gather all pieces in full matrix.
